AmfAliasr
=========

If you're using RubyAMF to act with a FLEX application and you want to use some ruby methods attached to your model in your FLEX application
you have to define a useless setter methods every time. Also, since in ActionScript there is no support for boolean methods. 

Be lazy, use AmfAliasr to take care about that. 

Example
=======

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base

  amf_alias :full_name, :is_overage?

  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end

  def is_overage?
    self.age > 18 unless self.age.nil?
  end

end
